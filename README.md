# Minecraft-Like Voxel Engine

This repository contains a Minecraft-like voxel engine written in Java using LWJGL. The project focuses on rendering voxel-based worlds using rasterization and explores various optimization techniques to improve rendering performance and data management.

## Features

This project was created as a learning exercise to experiment with optimization techniques and advanced rendering concepts for voxel-based worlds.

Voxel-Based Worlds: Create, manage, and render large voxel environments.

Chunk System: Divide the world into manageable chunks for efficient rendering and memory usage.

Optimized Rasterization: Techniques like face culling, greedy meshing, and level of detail (LOD) to improve performance.

Lighting and Shadows: Basic support for ambient and directional lighting.

Camera Control: First-person and free-fly camera for exploring the world.

Procedural Terrain Generation: Noise-based algorithms to generate diverse landscapes.

Tech Stack
